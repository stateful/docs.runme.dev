# Install Runme on Cloud Development Environments

Runme can easily be integrated with Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) like [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview), [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), and [Project IDX](https://idx.dev/) to enhance development process by creating a ready-to-code environments with an interactive notebook. Experience the ease of dependable documentation and instantly-ready coding setups

In the sections below, we will provide step-by-step instructions for installing Runme in your favorite Cloud Development Environments.

## **GitHub Codespaces**

GitHub codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that speeds up project setup by providing pre-configured environments for users and promotes collaborative development, testing, and debugging directly within GitHub. With the VS Code extension on GitHub Codespace, you can install Runme. This integration helps developers automate routine tasks and execute notebooks directly from your GitHub repository.

In this section, we will walk you through how to install Runme on GitHub Codespaces.

### **Creating a Codespace**

To create a codespace, do the following:

1. Navigate to a new repository.
2. Click `Code`.
3. Click + in the Codespaces tab to open a new Codespace on your repository.

Now, you have successfully installed Runme in your GitHub Codespaces.

## **Gitpod**

Gitpod is a cloud-based development environment that allows developers to launch ready-to-code environments from any Git repository instantly. Thus eliminating the need for manual setup and configuration, saving time and effort.

In this section, we will walk you through how to Install Runme on Gitpod.

### **Sign Up and Login**

The first step is to create an account and sign-in. To do this, go to the [Gitpod website](https://gitpod.io/), click on **‘Try for Free’** and sign up using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.

Once signed up, log in to Gitpod with the account you used earlier.

### **Creating a New Workspace**

After completing the signup and log-in process, the next step is to create a new workspace. To do this, follow the steps below:

- Navigate to the repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket that you want to work on.
- Add `gitpod.io/#` before the URL of the repository. For example, `https://github.com/user/repo` becomes `https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/user/repo`.
- Press Enter, and Gitpod will start setting up your workspace.

```sh {"id":"01J01CHB3T1KG1ZV9WT59RKDN2"}
open https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stateful/Runme-CDEs
```
