# Open Source

We are committed to building Runme in the open and hope you get involved. Runme's core repositories operate under the widely accepted APL 2.0 license, and all source code is openly accessible on GitHub. Your engagement and contributions are welcomed as we work collaboratively to enhance the Runme platform.

## **Project Breakdown**

Runme is available in three repositories on Github:

- The project's website at [runme.dev](https://runme.dev)
- The [Runme repo (CLI and kernel server)](https://github.com/stateful/runme)
- The [Runme VS Code extension](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme)

## **Need help get started?**

For assistance or inquiries, please log any issues on [issues in Github](https://github.com/stateful/runme/issues), or [Join our Community](https://discord.gg/runme) - We look forward to your feedback and engagement.
