### Storage and Accessibility

- **Cloud Storage:** All auto-saved content is securely stored in a dedicated cell on the Runme Cloud. This ensures that your data is not only saved in real-time but is also accessible from any location, provided you have internet access.
- **Data Integrity and Security:** The Auto-Save feature is designed with data integrity and security in mind. Your work is saved in a consistent state, reducing the risk of data loss due to unexpected interruptions.
