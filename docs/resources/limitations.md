# **Known Limitations**

- Runme currently only has rudimentary support for PowerShell. While PowerShell is not limited to Windows, it is its primary platform. We recommend using [WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).
- Please [report any issues](https://github.com/stateful/runme/issues/new) you encounter, big or small, to help us make Runme better.
